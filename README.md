Using assets to create 1000s of unique but similar pieces of Art.
I'm creating an art gallery in a game in which there are a 1000 different but similar headshots of the character.

Instead of creating each of these individual headshots, is there any software available where I can just add assets that will spit out 1000 random headshots?

Thank You
